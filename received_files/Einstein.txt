The theory of relativity is a beautiful example of the basic character of the modern development of theory . In return one comes closer to the preeminent goal of science, that of encompassing a maximum of empirical contents .
 Theoretician is forced to allow himself to be directed by purely mathematical, formal points of view in the search for theories . The physical experience of the experimenter is not capable of leading us up to the regions of the highest abstraction .
 The empirical fact is the all-powerful judge . It can be handed down only on the basis of great and difficult intellectual effort that first bridges the wide space between the axioms and the testable consequences .
 Theorist must accomplish this task with the clear understanding that this effort may only be destined to prepare the way for a death sentence for his theory . One must allow him his fantasizing, since for him there is no other way to his goal whatsoever .
